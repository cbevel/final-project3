final-Project 

# **Overview**

This project is an online notebook that will allow users to be able to write, take note, jot a quick note, or anything they want to write. Users will have to create an account so that they can keep track of their posts and access them at a later time. Users will also have the ability to change background colors and fonts, including size and color.

The idea of creating an online notebook came from the idea of wanting writers to have a space to write down their creative thoughts without the complexity of creating a blog. I want to keep my application simple but creative while yet still keeping with theme of being digital as most things are now-a-days.
